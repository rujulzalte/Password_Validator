# Password_Validator
This is a code which can be used to validate if the entered password is strong password or not.

## Getting Started
Password validator is a code which can used to validate the strength of the mentioned password. Whole program is based on functions where various functions are defined to validate different test cases.

## Introduction
This project was build so that whenever a password is set it shouldn't be prone to any kind of attacks. To prevent it from vulnerability the password should be strong enough so that it doesn't  gets hacked. There are some basic validation criteria which can asure that the password mentioned is strong or not. Based on that the code is developed.

## Requirements
To run the code you are supposed to have [python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed in your device (IDE recomended).

* Version greater than **3.6.x**
* You also need [**CSV Library**](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41061824/install-csv-package-in-pycharm)

## Instructions
The code validates the given password on certain instructions which are mentioned here
* Password length has to be of minimum of 12 character

* Password string cannot be the [commonly used password](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_the_most_common_passwords#SplashData)

## How to Run
- To run the code you need to run the [source code](https://github.com/rujulzalte/Tic_Tac_Toe/blob/main/Tic_Tac_Toe_Game/Source_Code.py) file which is present.
- You need to make a copy of the [CSV file](https://github.com/rujulzalte/Password_Validator/blob/main/Password_Validator_Code/Common_password.csv) in your device.
- After creating copy in the device copy the file location of the CSV file in your device and paste the location in source code at **line 269**
